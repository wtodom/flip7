## Card Effects
### Action Cards
- **Freeze**: Immediately ends the round for the player who receives it. They cannot take any more actions but can still score points at round end.
- **Deal Three**: Immediately gives the player three additional cards, flipped one at a time. All card types count toward the three. Additional action cards revealed during Deal Three resolve after all three cards are drawn (unless player busts).
- **Second Chance**: Can be used when a player would bust. Discard both Second Chance and the busting card to continue playing. Players can only have one Second Chance at a time. If dealt a Second Chance while already having one, must give it to another active player or discard if none available. All Second Chance cards are discarded at round end, used or not.

### Bonus Cards
- All bonus cards are held until end of round scoring
- Bonus points are only applied if player doesn't bust

## Gameplay
- On a player's turn, they must either:
  1. Flip a card (receive one card from the deck)
  2. Pass (end their participation and score their cards)
- To "bust" is to receive a number card matching one already in hand
- If a player busts, they are out of the round and score 0 points
- If a player gets 7 unique number cards, the round immediately ends and they score 15 bonus points

## Round End
The round ends when either:
- All players have passed, been frozen, or busted
- A player collects 7 unique number cards

## Scoring
- Players who haven't busted score the sum of their number cards
- Bonus cards modify the final score
- Frozen players can still score points
- Busted players score 0 regardless of bonus cards
- 7 unique number cards awards 15 bonus points
